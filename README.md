# What's a good reason why  the pure Levenshtein Distance algorithm might be a more effective solution than the broader Damerau–Levenshtein Distance algorithm in this specific scenario?

Answer: 
Minimum number of operations(insertions, delete, substitutions) required to change A to B.
It might be a more effective solution than the broader Damerau–Levenshtein Distance algorithm
because it is faster, doesn't need to account for transposition of two adjacent characters as a possible step.

# What's a good reason why  the pure Levenshtein Distance algorithm might be a more effective solution than the broader Damerau–Levenshtein Distance algorithm in this specific scenario?


Answer: The Levenshtein Distance algorithm (LDA) might be a more effective solution than the broader Damerau–Levenshtein Distance algorithm
because
